# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview
* This application is designed to implement search query of users input from web forms.
* These submitted forms directed to a film controller that determine what methods needed to be use for the incoming data, and redirect to web page with the modified data. 
* The data was only accessed through our DAO implementation that use prepared statements with a bind.
* This information gather from the DAO would be placed into their respective entity(ies).
* Allowing for us to then modify or send to the display pages as needed.

## Technogies Used

## Lessons Learned
* First and foremost
	* Code is read more often then written.
	* Typos that do affect the code without effect of being caught before compile, cost a lot more time. Time is money for the company.
